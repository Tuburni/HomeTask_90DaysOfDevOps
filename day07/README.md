### Task decomposition ( from [Global Logic](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day07/tasks.md) by [Shubham Londhe](https://github.com/LondheShubham153)):
> *Requirements:*
 1) You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers
 2) Write a small blog or article to install these tools using package managers on Ubuntu and CentOS
 3) check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed)
 4) stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots
 5) read about the commands systemctl vs service
